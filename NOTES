Generating an S/B tree for bounds [1/365, 2/365] takes a long time, I
think because generation is exponential in the denominator.  Generation
should prune out non-interesting intervals that cannot possibly contain
values that satisy the filter.

For arbitrary filters no pruning is possible, but for range filters
one can discard the interval [a,b] from the push call if both filter(a)
and filter(b) fail.
